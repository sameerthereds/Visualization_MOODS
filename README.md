## **⚙️ System Functionality**  
The **Personal Informatics System** is fully automated and operates as follows:  
✅ **Data Extraction**  
- Automatically retrieves **stress-related data** from each user **for the past week**.  
- Processes raw data and applies **noise reduction techniques** to filter artifacts.  

✅ **Visualization Generation**  
- Generates **16 types of visualizations** to support **stress awareness & reflection**.  
- Designed to help users **identify patterns** in their stressor experiences.  

✅ **Automated Email Delivery**  
- Every **Sunday**, the system **automatically emails personalized visualizations** to users.  
- Ensures participants receive real-time insights without manual intervention.
